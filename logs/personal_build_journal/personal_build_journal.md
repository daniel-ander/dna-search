# Project Ideas

- The idea of this project is to step into the world of bioinformatics with a simple DNA Search Tool
- As of creating this repo and project, I know little about the field, so this will be an exciting learning experience. 
- 


## What I need! 

### Try to keep this clean. Break up tasks into individual modules. Build blocks upon blocks. 
- We first need a way to get the FASTA file-text into the program
    - This means you need to learn what FASTA format really is
    - We need to have it parse the input, break at points it needs to break at, etc
- After that, we have to deal with searching. Again, more information is required. 

- If you want to tackle UI, then you'll likely want to build this with that eventually in mind. 

- Keep any util functions inside the utils folder. 

- Add __init__.py to all of your folders to then iomport them
